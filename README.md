# Food-Classifier-NN
I experimented with multiple ANN and CNN models with the goal of classifying 10 different food types. The food dataset is from [Kmader Kaggle]([https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/food41]).

## Setup
To set up this project, first download the dataset from [Kmader Kaggle]([https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/food41]), then unzip the archive.zip and run Image_Preprocessing.py, which creates the train, test, and validation folders.
